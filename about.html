        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Garima Sedhai</strong>, a passionate and dedicated BCA student from Kathmandu, Nepal.
         With a strong interest in front-end development and design,
         I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional and visually appealing websites.
         My journey in tech began with curiosity and has grown into a deep desire to build
         solutions that solve real-world problems using code and data.</p>

        <p>Over the past few years, I’ve built projects using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and gained
         hands-on experience in object-oriented programming with <strong>Java</strong>. I’ve also explored my
         creative side through graphic designing, working with tools like <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>,
         <strong>Photoshop</strong>, and <strong>Canva</strong>.</p>

        <p>Beyond technical skills, I believe in <em>continuous learning</em>, staying curious,
         and using technology to make a positive impact.
         I’m currently looking for an internship opportunity where I can apply my front-end skills,
         grow in a collaborative team, and contribute meaningfully.</p>
