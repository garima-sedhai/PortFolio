        <h1>My Skills in HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p>
            As a BCA student, I have actively worked on multiple academic projects using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which has helped me build responsive, well-structured, and clean web pages. I’ve developed portfolio websites and mini-projects that demonstrate my ability to structure content using semantic HTML and style them with modern CSS techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            With a keen eye for design, I also bring in my creativity through tools like <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, and <strong>Canva</strong> — skills that complement my front-end development work. I regularly use <strong>Flexbox</strong>, <strong>Grid</strong>, and <strong>media queries</strong> to make sure my designs are fully responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
            My strong foundation in HTML & CSS continues to grow with every project, and I’m passionate about creating elegant, accessible, and interactive user interfaces that not only look good but perform well too.
